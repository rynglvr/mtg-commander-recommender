# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è MTG Commander Deck Recommender

An AI-powered Magic: The Gathering Commander deck recommendation system that suggests cards with high synergy while respecting color identity rules.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses machine learning to find cards with similar mechanics and text
- **Color Identity Compliance**: Only recommends cards legal in your commander's color identity  
- **Web Interface**: Clean, user-friendly web app for easy card discovery
- **Budget Conscious**: Focuses on cards under $10
- **Keyword-Based Similarity**: Matches on important MTG mechanics like proliferate, defender, artifacts, etc.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers 4,000+ Commander-legal cards under $10 from Scryfall API
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converts card text into numerical features based on MTG keywords
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Uses cosine similarity to find mechanically similar cards
4. **Color Filtering**: Ensures all recommendations are legal in the commander's color identity
5. **Web Interface**: Presents results in an intuitive web application

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11**: Core programming language
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **TensorFlow**: ML framework (with Apple Silicon optimization)
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Scryfall API**: MTG card data source

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mtg-commander-recommender.git
   cd mtg-commander-recommender

2. **Set up Python environment**
   python3.11 -m venv mtg-env
   source mtg-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: mtg-env\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run data collection**
   jupyter notebook
   # Run 01_data_exploration.ipynb to collect fresh data

4. **Start app**
   python app.py

5. **Run app**
   Open your browser to http://localhost:5000

## üß† ML Approach
This project uses content-based filtering to recommend cards by analyzing MTG-specific keywords and mechanics rather than generic text similarity.
